# 🌟 NorthStar — In-House Goal Setting & Tracking Portal
NorthStar is a structured, digital Goal Setting & Tracking Portal built to eliminate fragmented, spreadsheet-driven performance workflows. It supports the full lifecycle of employee goals — from creation and alignment, through quarterly check-ins, to final performance visibility — across three clearly differentiated user roles: **Employee**, **Manager**, and **Admin**.

## Overview

NorthStar replaces manual, siloed goal-tracking with a role-aware digital portal. Key capabilities include:

- **Goal creation** with thrust areas, UoM types, weightage, and targets
- **Manager approval workflow** with inline editing, approval, and return-for-rework
- **Quarterly check-ins** with structured achievement logging and system-computed progress scores
- **Shared Goals** — departmental KPIs pushed by Admin/Manager to multiple employees, with achievement sync
- **Audit trail** for all post-lock changes
- **Organization hierarchy** view for structural clarity

---

## Authentication

NorthStar uses **JWT Bearer tokens**. All protected routes require the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Token Details

| Token | Expiry | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| Access Token | 60 minutes | `JWT_SECRET` |
| Refresh Token | 7 days | `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` |

**Access Token Payload:**
```json
{
  "sub": "employee_id",
  "role": "EMPLOYEE",
  "designation": "Software Engineer",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "iat": 1700000000,
  "exp": 1700003600
}
```

**Password hashing flow:**
```
plain_password  →  SHA-256(hex)  →  bcrypt hash  →  stored in DB
```
Verification reverses the same pre-hash before bcrypt comparison.

2. Fetches existing `LOCKED` and `SUBMITTED` goals for the employee
3. Total goal count (selected + locked + submitted) must not exceed **8**
4. Sum of weightages across all goals (selected + locked + submitted) must equal **100**

**Response `200`:**
```json
{ "message": "Goals submitted successfully" }

  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Multiple quarters can be updated in a single call
- `achievement_value` must be >= 0
- Progress is computed per UoM (see [Progress Score Computation](#progress-score-computation))
- If the goal is a shared goal and the updater is the `primary_owner`, achievement is **synced to all linked copies** automatically

**Response `400`:**
```json
{ "detail": "These employee IDs were not found or are not active employees: ['EMP999']" }
```

---

#### `GET /shared-goals/pushed`

View all shared goals pushed by the authenticated manager/admin. Admins see all pushed shared goals; managers see only goals they pushed.

**Response `200`:** Array of `SharedGoalResponse`

---

### Organization APIs

**Tag:** `Organization APIs` · **Prefix:** `/organization`  
**Auth:** Bearer token required (any authenticated user)

---

#### `GET /organization/hierarchy`

Returns the full organization hierarchy as a tree structure based on `manager_id` relationships stored in the users collection.

**Algorithm:**
1. Fetches all active users
2. Builds a map of `employee_id → node`
3. Attaches each node as a child of its manager
4. Nodes with no manager (or self-referencing) become root nodes

**Response `200`:** Array of `HierarchyNode` (recursive tree)
```json
[
  {
    "employee_id": "EMP010",
    "name": "Carol Director",
    "designation": "Engineering Director",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "role": "MANAGER",
    "children": [
      {
        "employee_id": "EMP001",
        "name": "Alice Johnson",
        "designation": "Software Engineer",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "role": "EMPLOYEE",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Business Rules & Validations

### Goal Creation
- Minimum weightage per goal: **10%**
- Maximum weightage per goal: **100%**
- Minimum thrust area / title length: **3 characters**

### Goal Submission
- Total weightage across all active goals (DRAFT + SUBMITTED + LOCKED) must equal **100%**
- Maximum **8 goals** per employee (combined DRAFT + SUBMITTED + LOCKED)
- At least **1 goal** must be selected for submission

### Goal Editing
- Only `DRAFT` or `RETURNED` goals can be edited or deleted
- Shared goal copies: only `weightage` can be changed; all other fields are locked

### Goal Approval (Manager)
- Only goals in `SUBMITTED` status can be approved or returned
- Manager can only act on goals where `manager_id` matches their own `employee_id`
- On approval, manager may optionally override `target_value` and/or `weightage`
- Approved goals transition to `LOCKED` — no further edits without Admin intervention

### Goal Unlock (Admin)
- Only `LOCKED` goals can be unlocked
- Unlock transitions status back to `RETURNED`
- All unlock events are audit-logged with before/after status

### Quarterly Check-in
- Only `LOCKED` goals can receive check-in updates
- Employee must own the goal
- Progress is auto-computed — see formula table below

## Progress Score Computation

Progress percentage is computed automatically during quarterly check-in based on the goal's `uom_type` and `measurement_type`:

| UoM Type | Measurement | Description | Formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NUMERIC` / `PERCENTAGE` | `MIN` | Higher is better (e.g. Sales Revenue) | `(achievement / target) × 100` |
| `NUMERIC` / `PERCENTAGE` | `MAX` | Lower is better (e.g. TAT, Cost) | `(target / achievement) × 100` |
| `NUMERIC` / `PERCENTAGE` | `MAX` | Achievement is zero (perfect) | `100%` |
| `ZERO_BASED` | — | Zero = Success (e.g. Safety incidents) | `achievement == 0 → 100%, else 0%` |
| `TIMELINE` | — | Date-based completion | `achievement_value` used directly as % |

> Note: Progress percentage is a **tracking metric only** — it is not used for formal ratings.

## Quarterly Check-in Schedule

| Period | Window Opens | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Goal Setting** | 1st May | Goal Creation, Submission & Approval |
| **Q1 Check-in** | July | Progress Update — Planned vs. Actual |
| **Q2 Check-in** | October | Progress Update — Planned vs. Actual |
| **Q3 Check-in** | January | Progress Update — Planned vs. Actual |
| **Q4 / Annual** | March / April | Final Achievement Capture |

---

## Audit Logging

Every significant action is recorded in the `logs` collection via `log_action()`:

| Action | Triggered By |
|---|---|
| `CREATE_GOAL` | Employee creates a goal |
| `UPDATE_GOAL` | Employee updates a goal |
| `DELETE_GOAL` | Employee deletes a draft goal |
| `SUBMIT_GOALS` | Employee submits goals for review |
| `APPROVE_GOAL` | Manager approves a goal |
| `RETURN_GOAL` | Manager returns a goal for rework |
| `COMMENT_ON_GOAL` | Manager adds a check-in comment |
| `UNLOCK_GOAL` | Admin unlocks a locked goal |
| `PUSH_SHARED_GOAL` | Admin/Manager pushes a shared goal |
| `UPDATE_SHARED_GOAL_WEIGHTAGE` | Employee adjusts shared goal weightage |
| `QUARTERLY_CHECKIN` | Employee logs quarterly achievement |
| `SYNC_SHARED_ACHIEVEMENT` | System syncs achievement to shared goal copies |

Each log entry stores: `user_id`, `action`, `details` (context-specific dict), and `timestamp`.

---

## Shared Goals

The Shared Goal feature allows an Admin or Manager to broadcast a departmental KPI to multiple employees simultaneously.

**How it works:**

1. Pusher calls `POST /shared-goals/push` with a list of `recipient_employee_ids`
2. A `source_goal_id` (ObjectId) is generated — this is the logical parent identifier shared across all copies
3. Each recipient gets their own goal document with `is_shared: true` and `source_goal_id` set
4. Recipients can only adjust `weightage` on their copy via `PATCH /employee/goals/{goal_id}/weightage`
5. All other fields (`title`, `target_value`, `uom_type`, `thrust_area`) are enforced read-only
6. When the **primary owner** logs a quarterly check-in, `sync_shared_achievement()` propagates `achievement_value`, `progress_percentage`, and `quarter` data to all other LOCKED copies of the same shared goal
